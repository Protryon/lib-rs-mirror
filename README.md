# Unofficial client for unofficial crates.io API

This reads and caches data that crates.io internally uses for its JS API. Please note: there is no official crates.io API. Please ask crates.io maintainers before using it.

Data from this API is also [available as a database dump](https://lib.rs/data), so you don't need to access the actual API if you only want to develop crates.rs or play with the data.
