burntsushi, h, https://gitlab.com/crates.rs/crates.rs/-/issues/121#note_1178288733, lib.rs calls cryptocurrencies a magic beans scam, etc. BurntSushi doesn't want to be a party to what he sees as sneering or similar editorializing on a web site that he perceives to be a crate index. (Even if he agrees with the substance of the editorial.)
