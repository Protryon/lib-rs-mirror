# Sorry, there's no next page for a reason

Crates in the category pages are sorted by their [ranking](/about), which is based on quality factors, maintenance, and relevance to the category. Crates that are not shown are most likely unmaintained, low quality, or not relevant to the category.

If you've scrolled past hundreds or even a thousand crates and still haven't found what you were looking for, you're unlikely to find it by looking through the next thousand of lower-quality less relevant crates. Use [search](/search) or specific keyword pages instead.
